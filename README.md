# JTS-HW3-Python

Mastering Python programming is the cornerstone to a career in Data Science.  The homework assignment took us through our first experience with this programming language.  By creating our own repositories on Github and using the syncing options with commits, we are on our way to creating good coding habits that are required of professionals in the data science field.  The assignments ask us to read a CSV file and output data based on processing this information.  In the PyBank file, the use of For loops to create new lists which then were processed with another For loop to create the month to month values, average, worse month and best month.  The final results were printed in the terminal and in a .txt file.  The PyPoll file also used a For loop to get voter count, candidate list and vote list.  Headers were printed with total votes and then a custom function to gather the stats per each candidate was called to create the body of the file and terminal printout.  The final step was to print the winner for both the .txt file and terminal display.
